### Finish

Ok, seems like we finish. Now let's re-read our code and make sure it is clean.

During the story, we learned that even complex functions with a big number of arguments can be refactored in a simple way, even without creating new classes.
Unit tests and refactoring capabilities of the IDE give a great help with it. 
You always can **play** with the code trying different kinds of refactoring in different places. 

Keep your code clean and readable.
